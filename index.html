                this is a simple blog site where i go in depth over each lesson and concept in learning in this course.
                im studying this  course from code codecadmy, its the full stack web development course. This course goes deep into many different concepts, and i dont want to have to study these concepts again, so the best way of making sure im understanding, and retaining what im going over is to use it practically.

                    Im not going to build a whole website just to use a specific concepts like display grid. how ever i can build a section of a page using a grid and test out many different rules on it, thatâ€™s a concept i can build on. how ever css units is something that a simple explanation can be plenty enough.
                </p>
                <p>
                    my goal is for this to be the last full course i take I will always learn more, but i want to be able to start building full web apps after this. I know it will be a while before im able to build really good apps but i just want to be able to start after this

            </div>
            <p>
                Ive studied many of these concepts especially the begging concepts (html and css) but because i usually just rush through, the concepts never stick, so i end up not remembering how to use them when im ready to build something. If i working with what im learning i should retain it better and have a deeper understanding.
