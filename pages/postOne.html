            <h2>The Ever Expanding Network</h2>
            <p>
                More than four billion people around the world are internet users and the total number of websites on the world wide web is nearing two billion. <br>So how did the internet start? In 1969, the United States Department of Defense funded the creation of ARPANET, a precursor network to the internet. ARPANET stands for Advanced Research Projects Agency Network. ARPANET connected supercomputing centers run by government agencies and universities.

                These institutions wanted to connect their individual networks for large-scale information transfer. However, many of them followed different standards and technical implementations. In the 1970s, the transmission control protocol and internet protocol, otherwise known as TCP/IP, were created to provide standards around the transfer of data that would allow these early networks to communicate with each other.

                TCP/IP was researched and specified throughout the 1970s and adopted in the early 1980s. As different networks adopted TCP/IP, the interconnected global network of networks that is today known as the internet was formed.

            <h2>The world ide Web</h2>
            <p>
                the internet and the wide web are different things despite the fact that they are both often used interchangeably, they are different. the internet is a collection of inter connected computers that can send information back and forth but the web is a little different, its a the browser and websites, more like  a mall where you can brows stores, paying for experiences, and instead of just connecting with one person. the world wide web introduced web browsers, websites with multimedia and the ability to connect with people.

            <h2>Browsers and Servers</h2>
            <p>
                how is the information sent back and forth, we use something called a client server model. in this model the client refers to the user, browser or device asking for the server for website files. a server is the computer serves the files a client asks for.
            </p>
            <h2>404 Status Code</h2>
            <p>
                When a server responds to a client, the server specifies a status code as a part of the response. Status codes indicate whether or not the HTTP request was successfully completed and if there was an error, they contain some information about the type of error that happened. The status code helps the browser know how to handle the data that was sent back with the response. Review the HTTP statuses below and see if any of them seem familiar.
