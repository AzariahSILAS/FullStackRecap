            <h2>table rows</h2>
            <p>
                The first step in entering data into the table is to add rows using the table row element: &lt;tr&gt;.
            </p>
            <img src="../assets/week1/tableExample.png" alt="" class="img">

            <h2>table data</h2>
            <p>
                Rows aren’t sufficient to add data to a table. Each cell element must also be defined. In HTML, you can add data using the table data element: &lt;td&gt;.
            </p>
            <img src="../assets/week1/tableData.png" alt="" class="img">
            <p>
                In the example above, two data points (73 and 81) were entered in the one row that exists. By adding two data points, we created two cells of data.
                If the table were displayed in the browser, it would show a table with one row and two columns.
            </p>
            
            <h2>Table Headings</h2>
            <p>
                Table data doesn’t make much sense without titles to describe what the data represents.
                To add titles to rows and columns, you can use the table heading element: &lt;th&gt;.
                The table heading element is used just like a table data element, except with a relevant title. Just like table data, a table heading must be placed within a table row.
            </p>
            <img src="../assets/week1/tableHeading.png" alt="" class="img">
            <p>
                What happened in the code above?
                First, a new row was added to hold the three headings: a blank heading, a Saturday heading, and a Sunday heading. The blank heading creates the extra table cell necessary to align the table headings correctly over the data they correspond to.
                In the second row, one table heading was added as a row title: Temperature.
                When rendered, this code will appear similar to the image below:
            </p>
            <img src="https://content.codecademy.com/courses/learn-html-tables/table_example.png" alt="" class="img">
            <p>
                Note, also, the use of the scope attribute, which can take one of two values:
                row - this value makes it clear that the heading is for a row.
                col - this value makes it clear that the heading is for a column.
                HTML code for tables may look a little strange at first, but analyzing it piece by piece helps make the code more understandable.

            <h2>Spanning Columns</h2>
            <p>
                What if the 
                Preview: Docs Loading link description
                table
                contains data that spans multiple columns?
                For example, a personal calendar could have events that span across multiple hours, or even multiple days.
                Data can span columns using the 
                Preview: Docs Specifies the number of columns a cell should span.
                colspan
                attribute. The attribute accepts an integer (greater than or equal to 1) to denote the number of columns it spans across.
            </p>

            <p>
                In the example above, the data Out of Town spans the Monday and Tuesday table 
                Preview: Docs Loading link description
                headings
                using the value 2 (two columns). The data Back in Town appears only under the Wednesday heading.
                Data can also span multiple rows using the 
                Preview: Docs Specifies the number of rows a cell should span.
                rowspan
                attribute.
            </p>
            <h2>table body</h2>
            <p>
                Over time, a table can grow to contain a lot of data and become very long. When this happens, the table can be sectioned off so that it is easier to manage.
                Long tables can be sectioned off using the table body element: &lt;tbody&gt;.
                The &lt;tbody&gt; element should contain all of the table’s data, excluding the table headings (more on this in a later exercise).
            </p>
            <img src="../assets/week1/tbody.png" alt="" class="img">
            <h2>table head</h2>
            <p>
                In the last exercise, the table’s headings were kept inside of the table’s body. When a table’s body is sectioned off, however, it also makes sense to section off the table’s column headings using the &lt;thead&gt; element.
            </p>

            <h2>table footer</h2>
            <p>
                The bottom part of a long table can also be sectioned off using the &lt;tfoot&gt;element.
            </p>

            <h2>Styling with CSS</h2>
            <p>
                Tables, by default, are very bland. They have no borders, the font color is black, and the typeface is the same type used for other HTML 
                Preview: Docs Loading link description
                elements.
                CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a language that web developers use to style the HTML content on a web page. You can use CSS to style tables. Specifically, you can style the various aspects mentioned above.
